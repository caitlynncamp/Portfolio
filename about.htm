            <p>When I was 5, I wanted to be President of the United States. Unlike my predecessors, whose names I could not even name at the time, I envisioned a fresh start. I planned to move the entire population of the United States onto Mars to create specified homes for each family's needs, and parks that would trace every building with community gardens to feed cities. Years later, with the realization that my parents might have let me watch a little too much of the HGTV channel, my dream is to still tell stories through creating experiences and environments for people to enjoy.
    
                As I got older, one thing remained constant—my unwavering attachment to Disney. Having had the privilege to be a guest at Disney theme parks, I was captivated by the unparalleled experience of immersing guests in interactive environments. This enchantment, combined with my passion for storytelling and user experience, steered me towards Interactive Design. Along my journey, I honed various software skills, all the while observing how people interacted and reacted. It became evident to me that my perception of the world served as the canvas upon which I yearned to design and create.
                
                My aspiration, both then and now, is to create immersive experiences for people that transcend current design standards. Especially now, where the ability to escape into a place of your own comfort is a good way for people to connect to themselves, as well as others, helping everyone through their own darkening reality. After all, who doesn’t love a good story? 
                I would love to enhance my skills therefore, if you have a project I can help with, please feel free to reach out!
